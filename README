DESCRIPTION
    SMS::Send::AU::MyVodaphone is an regional SMS::Send driver for Australia
    that delivers messages via the <http://myvodafone.com.au> website
    Web2TXT feature.

    Using your phone number as a login, and your existing password, this
    driver allows any Australian with a Vodafone to send SMS messages (with
    the message cost added to your account).

  Preparing to Use This Driver
    As well as setting up your myvodfone.com.au account and password, the
    Web2TXT feature requires acceptance of an additional disclaimer and
    conditions of use form.

    You "must" manually accept this disclaimer and conditions before you
    will be able to use this driver.

    While we certainly could make the driver do it for you, acceptance of
    the terms of use implies you understand the cost structure and rules
    surrounding the use of the Web2TXT feature.

  Disclaimer
    Other than dieing on encountering the terms of use form, no other
    protection is provided, and the authors of this driver take no
    responsibility for any costs accrued on your phone bill by using this
    module.

    Using this driver will cost you money. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

METHODS
  new
      # Create a new sender using this driver
      my $sender = SMS::Send->new(
            _login    => '04 444 444',
            _password => 'abcdefg',
            );

    The "new" constructor takes two parameters, which should be passed
    through from the SMS::Send constructor.

    The params are driver-specific for now, until SMS::Send adds a standard
    set of params for specifying the login and password.

    _login
        The "_login" param should be your phone number. That is, the phone
        to send from and to be billed to for the messages.

        The login should be an Australian-format number. That is, starting
        with zero-four "04".

    _password
        The "_password" param should be your myvodafone.com.au password.

    During construction, the driver will actively log in to the
    myvodafone.com.au website using the credentials provided, to verify they
    are correct.

    It will not check for your acceptance of the terms and conditions at
    this point. That is done at "send_sms"-time.

    Returns a new "SMS::Send::AU::MyVodafone" object, or dies on error.
